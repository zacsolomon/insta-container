insta-container.sh

insta-container asks a couple of questions about what kind of LXC container you want to create
then it automates the boring parts of creating a container so you can get straight to work 


I created this because I got tired of going through a bunch of prompts when creating containers
to use in exercises when teaching cyber security concepts as SysAdmin for SDSU's Cyber Defense Team*
